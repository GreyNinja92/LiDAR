    <h1>LiDAR Enhanced AR</h1>
    <p>Augmented Reality is far from its nascent stages as a piece of technology.
    Today, we have several AR headsets, glasses & even smartphones with SDKs
    supporting AR functionality. AR requires quick computations of CNNs on
    device in real time to identify the depth of the scene to overlay objects,
    interfaces, etc.
    <br /><br />
    Most of the time, the depth information gathered after running the scene
    through a trained CNN is still slightly inaccurate. An Evidence of this can
    be seen in some AR games, where stationary objects in the game move around
    the environment as we move the cameras around. Due to poor depth estimation,
    the object is not able stay attached to the ground.
    <br /><br />
    Some people propose solving this issue by using a combination of Computer
    Vision principles and CNNs. They essentially track some features in the
    image and attach the object to those features. So, as the camera moves, the
    features will move and the object will move with the features creating an
    illusion that the object is stationary in virtual world. This will involve
    even more computation.
    <br /><br />
    To fix this, we can directly capture Ground Truth Depth Information from the
    Environment using LiDAR. We can then use this depth information to augment
    the surrounding space. It'll be faster since there are much fewer CNN
    computations required and much more accurate. The pro model of the iPhone ships with
    a LiDAR scanner for quick, easy & precise AR overlays onto the camera
    output. LiDAR is an acronym for Light Detection and Ranging. LiDAR sensors
    emits light beams and measures the time it takes for the beams to reflect
    and come back into the sensor. It then uses this measurement to create a
    depth map. We've used LiDAR sensors already in several places for e.g. the
    Mars Rover. This helped the robot easily identify what's in front of it and
    make decisions about it's route accordingly.</p>
